# Jazz Framework

Jazz is a modern web framework inspired by Laravel, combining the simplicity of Laravel's developer experience with the high performance of Go and the flexibility of React with TypeScript. Designed to help developers build scalable, maintainable, and efficient web applications, Jazz provides a balanced environment for frontend and backend development.

## Features

- **Backend in Go**: High-performance backend leveraging Go's efficiency for building robust services.
- **Frontend in React TypeScript**: Modern, component-based UI development with the power of TypeScript.
- **Inspired by Laravel**: Familiar syntax and concepts such as routing, middleware, and ORM, for a smooth transition for Laravel developers.
- **Developer Productivity**: Focus on clear project structure and powerful features, inspired by Laravel's artisan tool.

## Automation with "Maestro"

Similar to Laravel's Artisan, Jazz introduces **Maestro**, a command-line tool for project automation. With Maestro, you can generate code, manage migrations, start development servers, and much more. The goal is to provide a smooth and efficient workflow for developers, reducing repetitive tasks and boosting productivity.

## Getting Started

To get started with Jazz, simply clone the repository and use Maestro to scaffold your project components:

```bash
maestro new project-name
```

This command will set up a new Jazz project with the recommended directory structure and dependencies.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation will be available to guide you through everything Jazz has to offer, from setting up your environment to creating full-stack applications. Stay tuned!
